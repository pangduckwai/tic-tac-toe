# tic-tac-toe
This is my attempt to implement a self-contained Tic Tac Toe game employing the [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) principle.

## Deployment
Since it is meant to be self-contain, everything you need is in this repository.

### Deploying locally

1. Copy all the source code here into a directory.

1. Open `index.html` in Firefox. Other browsers should work, it is just that I didn't test on any other.

### Deploying online

- There is no special setup on the server side, as the whole thing is running on the client's browser

## NOTE
Although the code support 3x3 to 9x9 board sizes, testing shows that one starts experiencing minor lags with a 4x4 board, on Firefox running on an i7-7500U machine with 8GB of RAM.
